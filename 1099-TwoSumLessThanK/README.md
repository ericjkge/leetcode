Given an array nums of integers and integer k, return the maximum sum such that there exists i < j with nums[i] + nums[j] = sum and sum < k. If no i, j exist satisfying this equation, return -1.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], k = 60
Output: 58
Explanation: We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,20,30], k = 15
Output: -1
Explanation: In this case it is not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 100
	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
	1 <= k <= 2000
